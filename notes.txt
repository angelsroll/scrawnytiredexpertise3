todo:
  main screen:
    1) fix landing location (it seems like angle is taken into account over distance)
    2) add in images
    3) make creature location/size follow existing equations
    4) make ball on main screen appear in front of or behind creature pending distance
    5) creature animations?
    6) put name, type, catch chance at top of screen
    7) rotate ball in motion
    8) contact triggers catch animation
    9) add in catch chance calculation, either reverse catch animation or move on to next
    10) take off top bar/inputs

  side screen:
    1) add creature image
    2) make sidescreen user for historylog be the array user GOOD

  log: CHECk
    1) far right location, header GOOD
    2) top to bottom GOOD
    3) user and relation to object: way short, short, contact, long, way long options GOOD

  queue:
    1) right location, header GOOD
    2) bottom to top GOOD
    3) include 2 mins slowmode time ticker on people who threw recently GOOD
    4) re-sort queue if people without slowmode cut in line GOOD
    Troubleshoot queue (sometimes throws stay logged longer than they should. Need to check on when queue is cleared.)

multiple scenes:
  same zone:
    1) initial animation, also each catch triggers
    2) fetch assets (creature, noise)
    3) fetch variables (distance, height, size, name, type, catch rate)

  different zone:
    1) intro animation
    2) fetch assets(background, music)
    3) fetch variables (physics equations)

  zone specifics:
    1) grass: basics (limit power to 300 and angle to 10-90)
    2) volcano: final height variable based on looking up slope (effects: duration and distance, dne: initalVelocities, peakHeight), axis indicator on sideScreen
    3) air: variable flight speeds, adds wind resistance factor based on speed (will impact sideview heavily as well)
    4) water: ball is slightly bouyant, need negative angles for throwing, add water resistance on ball to x velocity
    5) city: basics, add animated objects at set distance for impact, plus physics on ball after impace, omit creature location within set distance
    6) cave: basics, moving flying creature location (side view as well)

assets:
  art:
    1) ball in 3d
    2) ball open
    3) ball 3 different catch phases
    4) grass, volcano, air, water, city, cave backgrounds
    5) 51 creatures (and greyscale side profiles)

  audio:
    1) grass, volcano, air, water, city, cave background music
    2) creature audio? can be reused
    3) throw sound (based on long/short)
    4) catch noises (contact and 3 phases)

  animation:
    1) catch animation
    2) between creatures animation
    3) between locations videos
    4) intro video
    5) outtro video
    6) city objects movement
    7) final creature movement

  misc:
    1) creature names, types, catch rates
